        "1.1 Qualitative (Categorical) Data\n",
        "Represents non-numeric characteristics or labels.\n",
        "\n",
        "Nominal Scale: Categories without a specific order (e.g., eye color, gender, nationality).\n",
        "Ordinal Scale: Categories with a meaningful order but without a fixed interval (e.g., satisfaction levels: poor, fair, good, excellent).\n",
        "1.2 Quantitative (Numerical) Data\n",
        "Represents numeric values with meaningful mathematical operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interval Scale: Numeric values with equal intervals but no true zero (e.g., temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit).\n",
        "Ratio Scale: Numeric values with a true zero, allowing meaningful ratios (e.g., height, weight, age, income).\n",
        "2. Measures of Central Tendency\n",
